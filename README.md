# Sentiment Analysis With A Streamlit UI

## Project Overview
This project is a web application for sentiment analysis built using Streamlit. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining or emotion artificial intelligence, uses natural language processing (NLP), text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information. The application analyzes digital text to determine if the emotional tone of the message is positive, negative, or neutral.
